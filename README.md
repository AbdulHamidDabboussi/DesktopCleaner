# Desktop Cleaner
Inspired by Apple's new Stacks feature in macOS Mojave, this script is a simple Windows version. It creates orginization
folders in the directory it's placed in and then organizes all available files into these folders based on the file's format.

Instructions:

	1. Place the script inside the directory to be organized, such as the Desktop.
	2. Run the script in cmd: python DesktopCleaner.py
